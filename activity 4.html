    <p style="background-color: red;">>The HTML was developed in 1990. This was developed by Tim Berners Lee and his colleagues at the European Organization for Nuclear search. 
This was created based on the idea of sharing documents among researchers. In order to make this idea real, HTML was developed. This contains some tags which let the user link one web page to other web pages. In short, we can name it hyperlinks. Now to make the hyperlink possible we need a text, which we can call hypertext. This hypertext
enables the fact of linking one webpage to the other web pages. Now when a user clicks on the text which is serving as a link, they can visit the other web pages</p>
